          <h3 id="headline"> Here's a time line of Albert Einstein:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1879</strong> - Born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire,</li>
            <li><strong>1880</strong> - The family moved to Munich, where Einstein's father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.</li>
            <li><strong>1887</strong> - At the age of 8, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later.</li>
            <li><strong>1894</strong> - Parents move to Milan Six months later, Einstein leaves Gymnasium without completing his schooling and joins his family in Pavia, Italy</li>
            <li><strong>1896</strong> - Renounces his German citizenship</li>
            <li><strong>1901</strong> - Acquires Swiss citizenship.Completes his first scientific paper</li>
            <li><strong>1903</strong> - Albert Einstein marries his longtime girlfriend, Milena Maric.</li>
            <li><strong>1905</strong> - Over the course of a year that he will later describe as his "Annus Mirabilis"—his miraculous year—Albert Einstein publishes four major theoretical papers in the prestigious German academic journal Annalen Der Physik. The four papers include a groundbreaking new interpretation of the photoelectric effect (for which Einstein will eventually win the Nobel Prize) as well as the first published exploration of the theory of Special Relativity and the first formulation of the famous equation e=mc2.</li>
            <li><strong>1915</strong> - Einstein completes his General Theory of Relativity. </li>
            <li><strong>1919</strong> - A solar eclipse provides dramatic observable evidence that Einstein's General Theory of Relativity is correct. Einstein suddenly becomes a worldwide celebrity.</li>
            <li><strong>1921</strong> - Albert Einstein wins the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the photoelectric effect, first published in 1905.</li>
            <li><strong>1933</strong> - Albert Einstein and his family, fearing anti-Semitic persecution, flee from Nazi Germany to resettle in the United States. Einstein takes a post at Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, where he will remain until his death in 1955.</li>
            <li><strong>1939</strong> - Fearing that Nazi scientists might win the race to develop the world's first atomic bombs, Albert Einstein writes a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, urging him to launch an American program of nuclear research.</li>
            <li><strong>1940</strong> - For the third time in his life, Albert Einstein changes his nationality, becoming a United States citizen while also retaining his Swiss citizenship.</li>
            <li><strong>1955</strong> - Albert Einstein dies of heart failure at the age of 76.</li>
          </ul>
